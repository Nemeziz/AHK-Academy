So now you decided that you want to send (type) keys to a program. 
<p>We can do that. Use the Send command. Send literally sends keystrokes, to simulate typing or pressing of keys.
<p>Before we get into things, here are some common issues that people have: 
<p>Just like Hotkeys, Send has special keys too 
<p>!: Sends the ALT key. For example, Send This is text!a would send the keys "This is text" and then press ALT+a
<p>+: Sends the SHIFT key. For example, Send +abC would send the text "AbC", and Send !+a would press ALT+SHIFT+a.
<p>^: Sends the CONTROL (Ctrl) key. For example, Send ^!a would press CTRL+ALT+a, and Send ^{Home} would send CONTROL+HOME. Note: ^A produces a different effect in some programs than ^a. This is because ^A presses CONTROL+SHIFT+A and ^a presses CONTROL+a. If in doubt, use lowercase.
<p>#: Sends the WIN key (the key with the Windows logo) therefore Send #e would hold down the Windows key and then press the letter "e".
